## 1.Project Description:
This project is designed for classification of 9 road intersections. As you know, there are many directions of an intersection and the view is quite different. Thus, according to the type of intersections, we devide each intersection into several child-class in order to improve the classification accuracy.

## 2.File Description:
Network.py:           design of our cnn network

datasets_prepare.py:  help you to build your own datasets

image_pre_process.py: make images ready to be send to the network

train.py:             train the designed network

test.py:              get the result of road intersection classification

## 3.Network Description
image -> conv1 -> pool1 -> conv2 -> pool2 -> conv3 -> pool3 -> fc1 -> fc2 -> fc3 -> softmax -> class

## 4.Functions:
Pool: max_pool

Activate: ReLU
